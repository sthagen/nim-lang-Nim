      - Thanks for your contributions!, your Bug report will receive feedback from the community soon...
      - Please check whether the problem still exists in the devel branch, see [rebuilding the compiler](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/intern.html#rebuilding-the-compiler).
      - Consider writing a PR targetting devel branch after filing this, see [contributing](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/contributing.html).
      - If it's a pre-existing compiler bug, see [Debugging the compiler](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/intern.html#debugging-the-compiler)
        which should give more context on a compiler crash.
      - If it's a regression, you can help us by identifying which version introduced the bug,
        see [Bisecting for regressions](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/intern.html#bisecting-for-regressions),
        or at least try known past releases (e.g. `choosenim 2.0.0`). The Nim repo also supports online bisecting
        via making a comment, which contains a code block starting by `!nim c`, `!nim js` etc. , see [nimrun-action](https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nimrun-action).
